# `Movie Search` â€” the app to search movies

The application uses a public api http://www.omdbapi.com/ to fetch the movie details. 


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `Typescript-Angular-Moviesearch` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `Typescript-Angular-Moviesearch` repository.

We also use a number of Node.js tools. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed.

### Clone `Typescript-Angular-Moviesearch`

Clone the `Typescript-Angular-Moviesearch` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/some-subhra/Typescript-Angular-Moviesearch.git
cd /Typescript-Angular-Moviesearch
```

### Install Dependencies & Run the Application

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` with a simple development web server. The simplest way to install dependencies and start this server is:

```
npm strat
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `npm install` and  `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files


Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/`][local-app-url].

### How the Application works

* Type the movie name in the search field
* Hit Enter-Key or Click on the search button
* Movie list will appear
* Movie list can be soarted accordingly through the sort buttons below the search field
* On hover over the ovie tile it will display Title,Year and Type
* On clicking any movie name it will take to the movie details page
